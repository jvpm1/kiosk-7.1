# Introduction

We are developing a self-service kiosk for Happy Herbivore, a vegan fast-food restaurant, with the goal of making the ordering process as simple and seamless as possible. Our concept is centered around ease of navigation and a smooth purchasing experience for customers.
The kiosk will feature a large introduction screen with a clear "Start Your Order" button, ensuring customers immediately understand that they can place an order. Once they tap to begin, they will be presented with a curated list of our best vegan menu items alongside a sidebar with category filters for selecting specific dishes.
Customers will also have the option to view detailed information about each product, including ingredients and nutritional facts. If a dish is customizable, users will be able to edit their selection before finalizing their order. Our goal is to make ordering delicious, plant-based fast food as effortless and enjoyable as possible.
